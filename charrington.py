#
# Charrington syncs your Google contacts into a local BBDB file.
#
# In 1984, Charrington was the member of the thought police who told Big Brother
# about Winston and Julia's secret apartment. In this context, he tells Big Brother
# (DataBase) about your contacts. OK, so it's a stretch...I was bored.
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Usage:
#
# There are a few wrinkles to this process, particularly since Google has tied
# Google+ in so tightly with your contacts. You almost certainly don't want every
# random person you've circled in your address book, but that's the default behavior.
# It is possible to limit the groups you pull down, and the system group "My Contacts"
# probably contains what you want. However, selecting which group to pull is not
# especially friendly. You have to give the group ID, which is a long URI with a
# relatively meaningless number at the end.
#
# The expected way for you to use Charrington is to set up a configuration file
# under ~/.charringtonrc with your login credentials for each account you want to
# fetch. Then run
#
#     charrington -g
#
# which tells Charrington to pull down all your group information rather than try
# to fetch your contacts. You should see, for each group, a name and and ID string.
# Find the groups you want, and then paste the entire ID string into your .charringtonrc
# file (under the correct account, of course).
#
# Once that is done, you can simply run
#
#     charrington > ~/.bbdb
#
# to sync your Google contacts back down into your local BBDB file.
#
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Known Issues:
#
# It doesn't yet do anything special with duplicates. You can always run bbdb-show-duplicates
# and fix things after the fact, but they'll reappear as soon as you run charrington
# again.
#
# There's no two-way syncing yet. I usually add new contacts infrequently enough that
# it's not a huge problem to do it via the web interface, but it would be nice to have
# some sort of rudimentary syncing at least.
#
# There's some information in Google that could probably fit into BBDB that I'm not
# currently doing anything with (job titles, that sort of thing).
#
# Note also that charrington currently requires Python 2.7.x.
